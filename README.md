**Step 3**: Now go to your package.json and you can see the installed dependencies with version like this
```
{
  "name": "crud_app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Crud Application with Express and mangoDB",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "Crud",
    "mangoDB"
  ],
  "author": "Ziaxdev",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.21.1",
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "dotenv": "^9.0.2",
    "ejs": "^3.1.6",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "mongoose": "^5.12.9",
    "morgan": "^1.10.0",

```

**Step 4**: Now replace the node with nodemon in the start of the script attribute of package.jason
```
 "scripts": {

    "start": "node server.js"
  },

**Step 5**: Now go to https://www.mongodb.com/ and create your free account and create a clustor and if you dont know how to set up mangodb cloud watch this tuitorial https://youtu.be/nwgQzuRRgec


**Step 6**: Now create a file congig.env and write 
```
PORT = 3000
MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://Admin:YOUR-PASSWORD@cluster0.qukgp.mongodb.net/YOUR-DATABASE-NAME?retryWrites=true&w=majority

```
  ** Replace YOUR-PASSWORD with your mongoDB clustor created password and replace YOUR-DATABASE-NAME with users and make sure you have replaced YOUR-DATABASE-NAME with users it is because I had used users to connect the db in this code everywhere.
  
  
**Step 8**: Now from the root directory run your server.js file by
